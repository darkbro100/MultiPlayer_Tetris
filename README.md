# MultiPlayer_Tetris

Tetris written in C++ with SDL2 and ASIO

Builds with CMake, not too sure how much this workspace will work across multiple systems so best of luck soldiers.

App itself should be cross-platform considering both ASIO and SDL are cross-platform and those are the only libraries used in this project.
